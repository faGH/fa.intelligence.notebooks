    "## Most Common Variable Types\n",
    "Variables are fundamental parts to any programming language. They reserve memory (RAM) that stores data. In short, they are placeholders where values can be stored and accessed. In many other programming languages, variable types have to be specified explicitly. Types can be things like integers, floats, doubles or booleans. Types can also be strings and more complicated object types (from 3rd party sources or classes that we create ourselves). Don't worry about any remotely fancy terms here as for the basics, we merely need to understand how to assign a value and how to access it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python however, we don't have to worry about such things but it's still valuable to understand that types do exist under-the-hood and how to check them. Let's see how to create a variable and then use it. When working with Python, we want to typically use 'snake_case' when naming variables or functions. This differs from one programming langauge to the next but these standards exist not out of necessity but rather to keep code neat, readable and maintainable. "
